This library is a collection of utils made entirely in TypeScript. Is the successor of [@vangware/micron](https://github.com/vangware/micron), with less focus on small footprint and higher focus on utility and readability across all JS environments (Node and the browser).

## Installation

You can use `npm`, `pnpm` or `yarn` to install it locally:

```bash
npm i -S @vangware/micro
```

Or you can use it directly as an ESM module trough services like [Pika](https://www.pika.dev/):

```js
import { isObject } from "https://cdn.pika.dev/@vangware/micro";
```
